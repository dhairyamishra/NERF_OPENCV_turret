I want to write a script using python.
This script should do computervision.
I want a super lightweight computervision model and a strong robust one.
I will be testing and debugging using my windows pc, but might choose to implement the lightweight script on a raspberry pi.
The script should give me an interactive dashboard that allows me to control values to change detection parameters
The dashboard should show 3 video feeds as well havving the following, 1 regular, 2 mask+contours, 3 infereneces.
I want to be able to swap between detecting faces, fingers, shapes. Make this possible in the dashboard.
Keep everything in one file so that it is easier to provide context back to you for debugging.
Also maintain a log file for each run for debugging issues.
I want the terminal output to also be modern and technically robust. It should also look beautiful, dont pront garbage data.
Lets go for the implementation.
